# **Course Project #1 – Python Average Calculator**

This project's main focus is to build a Python program to practice core programming concepts and gain hands‑on experience with Git and GitHub workflows. I have decided to tackle this project independently to strengthen my skills in functions, loops, and unit testing. However; I recreated this projected with a team, to solidify my ability to collaborate using Git Version Control. You can find the callaborative version of this project in my repositories, named "python_calculator2"!

## **Features**
Prompts the user for three integers (positive, negative, or zero)

Calculates the average (with decimals) of the three values

Compares each number to the average (above, below, or equal)

Loops until a special input ends the program and outputs the total sets processed

Includes unit tests for all major functions

## **Tools & Environment**
Language: Python 3.x

Testing: pytest or Python unittest

Version Control: Git + GitHub

## **How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the program:
   python main.py
4. Run the tests:
   python3 -m pytest "example test_introduction.py" (Run specific test)
   or
   python3 -m pytest -v (Run all tests in verbose mode - 4 total tests) 

## **Lessons Learned:**
- Implemented Python logic and learned how to effectively use unit tests. 

- Gained hands‑on experience with Git (commits, branches, pushing to GitHub).

- Built an understanding of the project workflow using Git and how to handle merge errors.
